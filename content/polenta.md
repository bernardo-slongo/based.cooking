Cornmeal preparation originated in Italy. This is how it is done by Venetian immigrants in Brazil.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: As long as the water takes to boil and you to set all ingredients.
- üç≥ Cook time: 40 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 4

## Ingredients

- 1500ml of water
- 1kg of cornmeal (We use the same one would use for cornbread, best if stone-ground.)
- Two teaspoons of salt (Taste it throughout the cooking, use this amount for safety)
- Two tablespoons of cooking oil (Optional)


## Directions

1. Add the water to a pot and heat it to a rolling boil.
2. Add salt (and optional oil)
3. Slowly add the cornmeal, while mixing it with a wooden spoon or a big whisk.
4. Keep mixing. If it feels too thick or thin, add more water or cornmeal, respectively. Keep in mind it will thicken with time.
5. When it has the consistency of a porridge and stops sticking to the pan (roughly 40min), remove it from heat and put it on a bowl or casserole.

You will notice some polenta will get stuck to the bottom and sides of your pan. Just fill it with water, and it will come off in some hours.

## Extra (Pairings and leftover use)

Polenta is bland by itself, but a fresh plate of it goes perfectly with elaborate meat sauces and stews, like these:
- [Traditional beef or lamb stew](https://based.cooking/beef-stew/), [Carbonade Flamande](https://based.cooking/carbonade/) or [Bolognese Sauce](https://based.cooking/bolognese-sauce/).

How we have it in my region:
- With a runny scrambled egg dish similar to a [frittata](https://based.cooking/frittata/), with pan-fried salami and semi-firm colonial cheese, called "Fortaia".
- Small kids have it with whole milk, i used to eat it with rice. Also, we [have a song about it](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=-nisfL47OCw).
- As for salads, we have it with a variant of chicory called "Radici", dressed with red wine vinegar. 

Leftover polenta, refrigerated or not, will get firmer and have a "shell" to it. Cut it into thick strips, put it on a frying pan, brown both sides and eat it with salami or steak! I find it even better that the fresh one.
